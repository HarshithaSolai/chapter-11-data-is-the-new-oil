   Documenting my learning journey of [Namaste React Live Course](https://learn.namastedev.com/) conducted by Akshay Saini

## Class Summary `Chapter-10 What is seen is sold` (28/01/2023)
  
  In this weekend (chpater-10 & chapter-11), we will be covering the two important layers of any Single Page Application - `UI layer` & `Data layer`. As the name says, Chapter-10 is all about UI layer where the presentation of the components is discussed. Started with various ways of writing CSS for app, we discussed about all the ways in brief and stated few examples of each method, its pros and cons. This chapter mainly focusses on a CSS framework `Tailwind CSS`. We tried converting the whole css that we wrote for our InstaFood app into Tailwind CSS. It will be painful in the beginning but definitely worth the try. 

  Find my version of detailed explanation of these concepts in [theory-assignment.md](https://github.com/Learn-React-With-Harshi/chapter-10-what-is-seen-is-sold/blob/main/theory-assignment.md). Check [coding-assignment.md](https://github.com/Learn-React-With-Harshi/chapter-10-what-is-seen-is-sold/blob/main/coding-assignment.md) for all the features that I implemented in this chapter.

One line about this chapter : `Leave the Styling (writing long classes in css files) to Tailwind, use its utility classes and concentrate on your logic part of the application `
